# SQL_Data_Analytics_Project

# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed for data exploration, analytics, and reporting within relational databases.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end analytical SQL skills by converting raw data into structured insights that support data-driven decision-making.
The queries are written with real-world business scenarios.

This project contains SQL queries covering a wide range of analytical tasks:

- **Database Exploration**:  
  Understand table structures, relationships, and data distributions. Identify missing values, duplicates, and data quality issues.

- **Measures & Metrics**:  
  Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), aggregations, ratios, and growth metrics that are essential for reporting and dashboards.

- **Time-Based Analysis**:  
  Analyze daily, monthly, and yearly trends. Perform YoY/MoM comparisons and rolling average calculations.

- **Cumulative & Advanced Analytics**:  
  Use window functions such as `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `LAG`, `LEAD` for running totals, cumulative metrics, and ranking-based insights.

- **Segmentation & Comparative Analysis**:  
  Segment data by customers, products, categories, or regions. Compare performance across different segments and cohorts.

- **Reporting-Focused Queries**:  
  SQL optimized for feeding dashboards and BI tools. Queries are structured to be reusable and readable for production-level reporting.
