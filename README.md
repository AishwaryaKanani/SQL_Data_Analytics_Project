# SQL_Data_Analytics_Project

# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed for data exploration, analytics, and reporting within relational databases.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end analytical SQL skills by converting raw data into structured insights that support data-driven decision-making.
The queries are written with real-world business scenarios.
